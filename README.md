== Secreto Mio ==

'''Secreto Mio''' is a Colombian adult content website that hosts subscription-based erotic videos. Founded in '''June 2022''', the project originally released videos on platforms like Pornhub and XVideos before launching its own standalone platform, '''secretomio.com''', on '''June 25, 2025'''. Secreto Mio emphasizes Latina performers and in-house video production.

== History ==

Secreto Mio began in 2022 with weekly video uploads to Pornhub. In 2024, the brand shifted focus to XVideos due to favorable exposure and features. In 2025, following changes to XVideos’ policies requiring newer creators to migrate to its subscription service Sheer.com, Secreto Mio deleted its content and moved to their own platform.

The official site, secretomio.com, launched on June 25, 2025, to centralize content distribution and manage subscriptions directly.

== Content and Platform ==

Secreto Mio produces original adult video content featuring independent Latina models, primarily based in Colombia. Videos are filmed in-house, blending amateur and professional production styles. The platform offers two subscription levels to differentiate access between archived and current content.

The site also accepts tips and custom content requests through a user contact form.

== Technical Infrastructure ==

Secreto Mio operates a responsive web interface, with no standalone app. Video content is streamed via the '''bunny.net''' content delivery network. Payments are handled through '''NowPayments''' using cryptocurrency to support user privacy.

Users can register for accounts, manage preferences, and view subscription history through a member dashboard.

== Legal Compliance ==

Secreto Mio states compliance with U.S. 18 U.S.C. § 2257 recordkeeping requirements. All performers are age-verified and documentation is maintained internally.

== Audience and Traffic ==

As of mid-2025, Secreto Mio reports receiving between 50,000 and 100,000 monthly visits. The audience includes viewers from a variety of countries, with a notable share from Brazil, despite the site not being localized for Portuguese-speaking users.

== Previous Platforms ==

Prior to launching its own site, Secreto Mio accumulated viewership across major adult video platforms, including Pornhub, XVideos, and Twitter. The creators report over 50 million views across these networks before transitioning to a self-hosted model in 2025.
